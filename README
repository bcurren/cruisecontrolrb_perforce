* This code has been tested on CruiseControl.rb 1.3.

There are some important notes:
* You need to set up your project manually, you can't do an "add" via CruiseControl.

To install/use it, put the perforce.rb file into your cruisecontrol/app/models directory.

Manually setup your project:
* Create a directory under the cruisecontrol/projects directory.
* Place a cruise_config.rb file in it. It should contain something like the following 
in order to use Perforce:
 
  Project.configure do |project|
    # Use Perforce for source control
    project.source_control = Perforce.new(
      :port => 'your.perforce.server:1666',
      :clientspec => 'clientspec-for-cruisecontrol',
      :user => 'buildusername',
      :password => 'builduserpassword',
      :p4path => '//depot/path/to/your/rails/app/...')
  end
  
* Sync your code once.
* Fire up CruiseControl, and let the games begin.

Usual disclaimer: I take no responsibility for your systems, code, etc. Read the code, 
test it out, backup your systems, etc.
